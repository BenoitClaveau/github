# Mastering Git Workflow

Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

## Create a repository

### What is repository

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

### Command Line Interface

'''shell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
git init
echo "me" >> contributors.txt
git a .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin master
'''
