Mastering Git Workflow
=========================

Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

## Setting up Git

1. Download and install the [latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Register your user name. 
```shell
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```
3. Register your email. 
```shell
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
```

### Authentication

Your authentication depends if you use HTTPS or SSH protocol.

#### HTTPS

If you clone with HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.
With Git for Windows, running the following in the command line will store your credentials:
```shell
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

#### SSH

If you clone with SSH, your SSH keys will be automatically used.

## Initializing the Repository

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

From the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project and enter git init to generate a new Git repository.

```shell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
git init
echo "me" >> contributors.txt
git a .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin master
```
From [GitHub Web Interface](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)

- In the upper-right corner of any page, click +, and then click New repository
- Create a short name
- Choose between creating a public or private repository.

```
git clone [url]
```

<a name="add"/>
## Adding a File

We need to add some files to be version controlled. This can be accomplished by adding specific files by name using the git add command:

```shell
git add .
```

<a name="commit"/>
## Committing Changes

Once a change has been made, it is best practice to commit that change to the repository.  All commitments in Git require a commit message

```shell
git commit -am "this is my local commit I want to push to remote repository"
```

Warning: if you created new file, you need to add it to your local repository before committing.

<a name="push"/>
## Pushing to a Remote Repository

Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.

```shell
git push
```

<a name="pull"/>
## Pulling from the Remote Repository

Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

```shell
git pull
```

Once the local repository is updated, any conflicting files will be observed and conflicts must be resolved, after which point editing can begin as normal until the local repository needs to be pushed back to the remote repository once again, and the process repeats until development is complete!

<a name="branch"/>
## Branching a repository

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named __master__ which is considered to be the definitive branch.
We use branches to __experiment__ and make __edits__ before committing them to __master__.

When you create a branch off the master branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

### To create a new branch

```shell
git branch [branch name]
git checkout [branch name]
```
